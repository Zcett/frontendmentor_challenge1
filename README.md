## My process

Firstly I tried to understand how the component was structured and how the card may be used on a page. My goal for this project was to, outside the intended scope, make the component replicabe without the need to edit the elements, outside of maybe the colors. I tried to replicate the QR code component using the mobile version background as reference because the scale between the background and the card was easier to grasp. The styling process was mostly referencing the elements to each other, break points and letter positions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex layout

### What I learned

This project gave me a better understanding on how displays work, although I belive that was not the point of the challenge. The reason is, despite not having a real need to make entries for the listed screen sizes on the excercise, I learned that is always good to have this in mind when choosing the units to work with to avoid complications when expanding your projects.

Being mindful of using names that makes sense to a possible reader, is a great way to keep your project clean. 


### Continued development

Without any previous experience other than reading some website pages and a youtube channel about HTML and CSS, I want to keep learning what I can about those. Hopefully I will understand a lot more, especialy the behavior of units and screen ratios, media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Dev Dreamer YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DevDreamer) - Watching his HTML and CSS playlists was the final piece for finally get me in learn new skills.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Useful to get examples and descriptions on everything that a stumbled on. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play) can be really handy when you are strugling with something.
